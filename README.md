# MysteryWord
Try and guess a word letter-by-letter.  This is a front-end Angular v5 application that demonstrates angular components, rxjs observables, ngrx/store configured in a Redux fashion, and reactive forms.  The styling is minimal, but sufficiently responsive.  I purposely left the data available to the front-end to benefit the example.

It's hosted [here](https://mystery-word-ng5.firebaseapp.com) via firebase.

This app utilizes a Node and Express back-end api under a [different repository](https://github.com/Garmhausen/mystery-word-api).

This project was a refactoring of a previous [MysteryWord](https://github.com/Garmhausen/MysteryWord) app that was built using Node and Express as a back-end with Mustache templates.  Hosted [here](https://mysteryword.herokuapp.com/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.2.

## Install

Clone/Download and run `yarn` (or `npm install` if you prefer) from within the app's directory.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
